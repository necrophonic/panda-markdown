Caffeinated Markup Language
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/necrophonic/text-caffeinatedmarkup.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/necrophonic/text-caffeinatedmarkup)

**Current Version 0.21**

The Caffeinated Markup Langauge is an attempt to create a simple yet rich markup language. It was originally created for blog postings on the [Caffeinated Panda Creations website](http://www.caffeinatedpandacreations.co.uk)

Although originally designed to translate to HTML, it has been structured such that it is as agnostic as possible to its output format.
