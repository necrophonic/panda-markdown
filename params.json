It was originally created for blog postings on the [Caffeinated Panda Creations website](http://www.caffeinatedpandacreations.co.uk)\r\n\r\nAlthough originally designed to translate to HTML, it has been structured such that it is as agnostic as possible to its output format.\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for work in progress spec: [Caffeinated Markup Wiki](https://github.com/necrophonic/text-caffeinatedmarkup/wiki)\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\n\r\nFor purposes of example, the output format is HTML and carriage returns are arbitrary for readability.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n```text\r\nA **wise** --man-- person once said, \"\"The quick brown //foo// jumps over the\r\nlazy //bar//|A.N.Other\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```text\r\n<p>A <strong>wise</strong> <del>man</del> person once said,</p>\r\n<blockquote>The quick brown <em>foo</em> jumps over the lazy <em>bar</em>\r\n<cite>A.N.Other</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich might look like:\r\n<p>A <strong>wise</strong> <del>man</del> person once said,</p>\r\n<blockquote>The quick brown <em>foo</em> jumps over the lazy <em>bar</em>\r\n<cite>A.N.Other</cite>\r\n</blockquote>","google":"UA-46855229-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
